  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I was a junior developer with a background in Computer Engineering,
    working in a hospital IT department where I managed SIMRS,
    maintained servers, and supported day-to-day operations. I brought a strong
    mix of tech skills and adaptability — solving real-world problems
    under pressure while ensuring systems stayed reliable and efficient.
  </p>
  <p>
    My main focus was full-stack web development using JavaScript-based
    technologies like{" "}
    <span className="footer-highlight">React</span> for the frontend,{" "}
    <span className="footer-highlight">Node.js</span> and{" "}
    <span className="footer-highlight">Express</span> for the backend, and{" "}
    <span className="footer-highlight">MySQL</span> for database
    management. I built responsive, scalable, and user-friendly
    applications with clean code and efficient architecture. For styling,
    I relied on <span className="footer-highlight">Tailwind CSS</span>, and
    I often used tools like{" "}
    <span className="footer-highlight">Postman</span> for API testing and{" "}
    <span className="footer-highlight">Navicat</span> for managing
    databases. My workflow included version control with{" "}
    <span className="footer-highlight">Git</span>, and I was comfortable
    working in both local and cloud-based environments.
    While my core stack was JavaScript-based, I also had experience with 
    <span className="footer-highlight"> Laravel</span> and used it{" "} 
    to build full-featured web applications, especially when PHP was 
    preferred for server-side logic or integration with legacy systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had hands-on experience working with{" "}
    <span className="footer-highlight">Linux</span>-based servers,
    handling tasks like automated service setups, system monitoring, and
    optimization — ensuring performance and stability for local network
    systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of tech, I helped run a small family bakery, where I applied
    creative thinking in product management, customer service, and
    marketing. This blend of technical and business experience made me a
    flexible and well-rounded developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was passionate about learning, building, and growing — always looking
    for opportunities to level up and contribute to meaningful projects.
